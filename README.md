# Central API - Endpoint Search Script

This menu driven Central API Script is designed to get your Token and store it securely locally on your system. Then you can use the Endpoint Search to located a Computer Name across all of your customers. This is useful when a system is accidently installed into the incorrect Central Admin Account and you have no idea which customer it was just installed into. 
  
You can enter the full or partial computer name. It will find all Endpoints that match.
  
This is a Powershell Script.
